# Hey, I’m Sahil

I'm an Software engineer interested in backend systems, low-level development, and OSS security.

Currently working on supply-chain security at **SafeDep**.  
On weekends, exploring Linux internals, databases, and OSS software supply-chain security.

## Things I’ve Built

- **AtomixDB**  
  A SQL database written from scratch in Go.  
  Reached 260k+ views, trended on Hacker News, and led to a tech talk invite at Just Eat Takeaway.

- **Runbox**  
  A sandbox built from scratch to explore process isolation, execution, and system-level behavior.

## Languages I’m Currently Working With

- **Go** – primary
- **C** – systems work (Runbox, Linux internals)
